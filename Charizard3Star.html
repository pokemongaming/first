<h1>3-Star Charizard Raid Guide – Best Counters, Weakness & CP</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>Raid Overview</h2>
<p>
3-Star Charizard is an offensive Fire and Flying type raid boss in Pokémon GO. 
Unlike its Mega evolutions, this version is more accessible and can be defeated solo 
with strong Rock-type attackers. Because of its dual typing, Charizard has a major 
double weakness that makes this raid significantly easier with the correct team.
</p>

<p>
This raid is ideal for trainers farming Charizard Candy, hunting strong IVs, 
or preparing a Fire-type attacker for PvE battles.

</p>

<h2>CP Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raid Boss CP:</strong> ~19,000</li>
<li><strong>Catch CP Range:</strong> 1574 – 1651</li>
<li><strong>Weather Boosted (Sunny/Windy):</strong> 1968 – 2064</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Can You Solo 3-Star Charizard?</h2>
<p>
Yes. Charizard is one of the easier 3-star raids due to its double weakness to Rock. 
Trainers Level 30+ with strong Rock attackers can complete this raid solo. 
Lower-level trainers may need one additional teammate for safety.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Weather Boost Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunny:</strong> Boosts Charizard’s Fire moves</li>
<li><strong>Windy:</strong> Boosts Flying moves</li>
<li><strong>Partly Cloudy:</strong> Boosts Rock-type counters (Best Condition)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Partly Cloudy weather is the best scenario for this raid because it strengthens 
Rock-type attacks while not boosting Charizard’s main damage types.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Battle Tips</h2>
<p>
Avoid using Grass or Bug types, as they are heavily resisted. Focus on pure Rock-type 
damage output for the fastest clear time. If Charizard has Blast Burn, dodging 
charged attacks can help preserve your top attackers.
</p>

<p>
If available, Mega Aerodactyl can boost Rock-type damage for the entire team, 
making the raid even easier.

</section>

<section>
<h2>Final Verdict</h2>
<p>
3-Star Charizard is a straightforward raid if you build around its Rock weakness. 
With proper preparation and weather advantage, this battle can be completed quickly 
and efficiently for strong IV catches and candy farming.
