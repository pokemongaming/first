    <h1>Mega Charizard X Raid Guide — Best Counters, Teams & Strategy</h1>
    <p class="lead">Mega Charizard X is a fearsome Fire/Dragon-type presence in raids. In this guide you'll find the best counters, recommended party lineups, moveset breakdown, weather effects, and practical tips to beat it efficiently — written in a friendly, gaming-blog style so you can jump straight into raids.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Mega Charizard X — Quick Overview</h2>
    <p>Mega Charizard X sports a blend of Fire and Dragon characteristics that make it dangerous against Grass, Bug, Steel and Fairy types, while it resists Fire and Electric. In Pokémon GO it typically has a moveset that includes powerful Fire moves and at least one Dragon or Flying charge move — so bring heavy Rock, Ground, Dragon and Water coverage depending on the raid moveset.</p>
    <p class="pro-tip"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Always check the raid boss's charged move before the fight starts — that single move can shift which counters are best.</p>

    <h2>Mega Charizard X Weakness & Type Chart</h2>
    <table aria-label="Weakness chart">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Effect vs Charizard X</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Rock</td><td>Super effective (×1.6)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Ground</td><td>Super effective (×1.6)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dragon</td><td>Super effective (×1.6)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Water</td><td>Neutral to super (depends on moves)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fire</td><td>Not effective (resisted)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Flying</td><td>Often super effective if Charizard uses Dragon Claw / Wing attacks</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="note">Note: In Pokémon GO typings and effectiveness can vary slightly with hidden mechanics; prioritize Rock/Ground/Dragon counters for the safest approach.</p>

    <h2>Mega Charizard X Best Counters (Top Ranked Pokémon)</h2>
    <p>Below are the most reliable counters across common raid movesets. This list weights survivability and DPS — ideal for both solo practice and organized groups.</p>

    <table aria-label="Best counters list">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Rank</th><th>Pokémon</th><th>Recommended Moveset</th><th>Why</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>Tyranitar (Smack Down / Stone Edge)</td><td>Smack Down / Stone Edge</td><td>Top Rock DPS and bulk — excellent vs Fire & Flying.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>Rhyperior (Smack Down / Rock Wrecker)</td><td>Smack Down / Rock Wrecker</td><td>High bulk and heavy Rock damage; great tanking option.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>Garchomp (Mud Shot / Outrage)</td><td>Mud Shot / Outrage</td><td>Dragon STAB with Ground coverage — versatile and fast.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>Dialga (Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor)</td><td>Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor</td><td>Top Dragon DPS and survivability.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>Groudon (Mud Shot / Precipice Blades)</td><td>Mud Shot / Precipice Blades</td><td>High Ground STAB and tankiness.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6</td><td>Excadrill (Mud-Slap / Drill Run)</td><td>Mud-Slap / Drill Run</td><td>Fast Ground damage with decent bulk.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7</td><td>Rampardos (Smack Down / Rock Slide)</td><td>Smack Down / Rock Slide</td><td>Top Glass-cannon Rock attacker.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8</td><td>Hydreigon (Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor)</td><td>Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor</td><td>Punchy Dragon attacker with good speed.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9</td><td>Rhyperior (alternative moves)</td><td>Smack Down / Earthquake</td><td>For mixed Rock/Ground matchups.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10</td><td>Gyarados (Waterfall / Hydro Pump)</td><td>Waterfall / Hydro Pump</td><td>Water for Fire coverage and solid bulk.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="small">Tip: If Mega Charizard X has a Dragon charge move, favor Dragon and Rock counters. If it runs a Fire + Flying combo, prioritize Rock types to exploit the double weakness from Flying + Fire to Rock.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Recommended Movesets & Counters Table</h2>
    <p>Match your party to the raid moveset. The table below maps common raid charged moves to the recommended counter types.</p>

    <table aria-label="Moveset to counter mapping">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Charizard X Charged Move</th><th>Primary Counter Type</th><th>Why</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Blast Burn / Outrage</td><td>Rock / Dragon</td><td>Hard-hitting Fire + Dragon — Rock and Dragon counters shine.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Flamethrower / Draco Meteor</td><td>Rock / Dragon</td><td>Still heavy Dragon damage — bring bulkier Dragon counters.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Overheat / Fire Blast</td><td>Rock / Water</td><td>If Overheat locked, Water can absorb Fire while Rock deals neutral damage.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wing Attack / Dragon Claw</td><td>Rock / Dragon</td><td>Wing opens a double weakness to Rock.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Many Players Are Needed?</h2>
    <table aria-label="players-needed">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Team Quality</th><th>Players Required (Approx.)</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Top meta teams (Tyranitar/Garchomp/Dialga lineups)</td><td>2–3</td><td>Very well-coordinated groups with optimal Pokémon.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Average strong players</td><td>3–5</td><td>Common scenario for most raid groups.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Mixed/entry-level players</td><td>6–8</td><td>Bring Rock/Ground/Dragon variety; more players compensate for lower IVs/levels.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="note">If you have multiple Mega Tyranitar in the raid party, the fight becomes significantly easier thanks to the Mega's Rock-boosting effect. Always consider Mega selection and team composition before joining.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Sample Party Builds (Practical Setups)</h2>
    <p>Here are sample parties you can use depending on what you have. Numbers are ordered by swap priority — start with the highest DPS and rotate in tankier counters as needed.</p>

    <h3>Top Meta Party (2–3 players)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Tyranitar (Smack Down / Stone Edge)</li>
      <li>Rhyperior (Smack Down / Rock Wrecker)</li>
      <li>Garchomp (Mud Shot / Outrage)</li>
      <li>Dialga (Dragon Breath / Draco Meteor)</li>
      <li>Groudon (Mud Shot / Precipice Blades)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Balanced Group Party (3–5 players)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Tyranitar</li>
      <li>Excadrill</li>
      <li>Rampardos</li>
      <li>Gyarados</li>
      <li>Garchomp</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Beginner / Casual Party (6–8 players)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Any high-level Rock attacker (Tyranitar/Rampardos)</li>
      <li>Any Ground or Dragon attacker</li>
      <li>High-level Water types as backup</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Battle Strategy — Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check the moveset</strong> before the raid starts — target your top counters accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead with your highest DPS Rock or Dragon</strong> — get early damage while shields are likely still up/unused.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch for overheat/charge move timing</strong> — if Charizard charges a big Fire nuke, consider switching to bulkier Water or Ground types to soak it.</li>
      <li><strong>Use shields wisely</strong> in smaller groups. Against Dragon heavy moves, save a shield for the second Dragon charge if possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Mega Tyranitar or Mega Garchomp</strong> if available — the Mega's benefit can swing tight fights in your favor.</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate in groups</strong> — let teammates know if you need to swap out after the first charged move.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="pro-tip">If you are soloing or a small squad, rotate Pokémon as they faint — sometimes a short switch to an Earthquake tank absorbs a charged move and preserves overall raid DPS.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>IV / Level & Candy Costs — Practical Notes</h2>
    <p>Don't worry about perfect IVs for raid counters — level and correct moveset are far more important. Maximize a couple of top counters (e.g., Tyranitar and Rhyperior) to save on Stardust and Candy. If you're tight on resources, powering one perfect Tyranitar and one good Garchomp will let you participate in most Charizard X raids effectively.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Weather Effects & How They Help</h2>
    <p>Weather can shift the best counters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sunny/Clear</strong> — boosts Fire; avoid bringing glassy Fire types to counter (they'll be stronger, but Charizard gets boosted too).</li>
      <li><strong>Partly Cloudy</strong> — boosts Rock moves, which helps your Tyranitar and Rampardos.</li>
      <li><strong>Windy</strong> — boosts Dragon moves (be careful — Charizard X's Dragon attacks will be stronger).</li>
      <li><strong>Rain</strong> — boosts Water counters like Gyarados, which can be helpful if Charizard uses heavy Fire moves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Always adapt: a boosted Rock weather match means your Tyranitar will shine even more.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not checking the raid charged move — one move can invalidate your entire party choice.</li>
      <li>Bringing only Water types when Charizard has a Dragon charged move — Dragon counters will outperform pure Water here.</li>
      <li>Wasting shields early in large groups — preserve them for clutch moments in small squads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Q: <q>Is Mega Charizard X weak to Rock?</q></h3>
      <p>A: Yes — Rock is one of Charizard X's main weaknesses. Rock moves (Stone Edge, Rock Slide) are extremely effective and should be prioritized.</p>

      <h3>Q: <q>Can I solo Mega Charizard X?</q></h3>
      <p>A: Soloing depends on player level, Pokémon level, and whether you have optimized counters. In general, soloing is difficult unless you have multiple maxed-out Rock/Dragon counters. Small groups of 2–3 well-prepared trainers are much more reliable.</p>

      <h3>Q: <q>Which Mega is best to bring?</q></h3>
      <p>A: Mega Tyranitar is the top pick for increasing Rock damage and making the raid shorter. Mega Gardevoir or Mega Garchomp can be useful situationally, but Mega Tyranitar offers the clearest benefit against Charizard X.</p>

      <h3>Q: <q>Does weather change recommended counters?</q></h3>
      <p>A: Yes — weather boosts can make Water or Rock counters more potent. Check local weather and adapt: Partly Cloudy (Rock boost) strongly favors Rock attackers.</p>

      <h3>Q: <q>What if Charizard X has Draco Meteor?</q></h3>
      <p>A: Draco Meteor is brutal. Favor bulky Dragon counters like Dialga and bring shields for your key Pokémon. Coordinate with teammates to spread out when to use shields.</p>
