<h1>Mega Evolution Strategy Guide – When and How to Use Mega Pokémon in Pokémon GO</h1>

<p>
Mega Evolution is one of the most powerful mechanics in Pokémon GO.
When used correctly, Mega Pokémon can dramatically increase raid damage,
boost candy gains, and strengthen your entire team. However, many trainers
do not fully understand how Mega bonuses work or when they should activate
a Mega Evolution.
</p>

<p>
This complete strategy guide explains how Mega boosts function,
how to coordinate Mega Pokémon in raids, and when Mega Evolution is truly worth using.
</p>

<h2>What Is Mega Evolution?</h2>

<p>
Mega Evolution temporarily transforms certain Pokémon into stronger forms.
When Mega Evolved, a Pokémon gains increased CP, stronger stats,
and provides bonus effects to other trainers in battle.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Higher Attack stats</li>
<li>Team damage boost</li>
<li>Bonus Candy for matching types</li>
<li>Temporary transformation (8 hours active)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unlike standard evolutions, Mega Evolution requires Mega Energy
that is earned primarily through Mega Raids.
</p>

<h2>How Mega Damage Boost Works</h2>

<p>
When a Mega Pokémon is active in a raid:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All other trainers receive a damage boost</li>
<li>Pokémon that share a type with the Mega receive an additional bonus</li>
</ul>

<p>
This means coordination is extremely important.
If one trainer activates a Mega Pokémon of the correct type,
the entire lobby benefits.
</p>

<p>
For example, using a Mega Fire-type Pokémon against a Grass raid boss
boosts all Fire-type attackers in the raid group.

<h2>When Should You Mega Evolve?</h2>

<h3>1️⃣ Legendary Raids</h3>
<p>
Mega Evolution is most effective during Tier 5 and Elite raids,
where maximizing damage reduces battle time and fainting.
</p>

<h3>2️⃣ Short-Player Groups</h3>
<p>
If you are raiding with only 2–3 trainers,
Mega boosts can make the difference between winning and timing out.
</p>

<h3>3️⃣ Candy Farming</h3>
<p>
Mega Pokémon increase Candy rewards for Pokémon that share their type.
If you're grinding for XL Candy, activating a Mega before catching is highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>Best Types to Mega Evolve in Raids</h2>

<p>
The most valuable Mega Evolutions are those that match common raid boss weaknesses:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Dragon-type Megas (for Dragon raids)</li>
<li>Dark-type Megas (for Psychic raids)</li>
<li>Fighting-type Megas (for Normal and Steel raids)</li>
<li>Ice-type Megas (for Dragon and Flying raids)</li>
<li>Ground-type Megas (for Electric raids)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Choosing the correct Mega type can significantly reduce raid completion time.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mega Level System Explained</h2>

<p>
Each Mega Pokémon has three Mega Levels:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Base Level</li>
<li>High Level</li>
<li>Max Level</li>
</ul>

<p>
As Mega Level increases:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Mega Energy cost decreases</li>
<li>Cooldown time shortens</li>
<li>Candy bonuses increase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Powering up Mega Levels is a long-term investment that benefits frequent raiders.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mega Evolution Mistakes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mega evolving the wrong type for a raid</li>
<li>Using Mega Pokémon that do not match team counters</li>
<li>Ignoring Mega Level upgrades</li>
<li>Activating multiple Megas of the same type in one lobby unnecessarily</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only one Mega boost is necessary in most raids.
Coordination prevents wasted Mega Energy.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Shadow vs Mega – Which Is Better?</h2>

<p>
Shadow Pokémon deal 20% more damage but take more damage.
Mega Pokémon provide team-wide boosts.
</p>

<p>
In solo or duo raids, Shadow attackers often deal higher individual DPS.
In group raids, Mega Pokémon increase total team damage.
</p>

<p>
The best strategy often combines both.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Is Mega Evolution Worth It?</h2>

<p>
Yes — when used strategically.
Mega Evolution is most valuable in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Legendary raids</li>
<li>Elite raids</li>
<li>Candy farming events</li>
<li>Short-player raid groups</li>
</ul>

<p>
For casual gym battles, Mega Evolution is usually unnecessary.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
Mega Evolution is more than just a visual upgrade.
It is a strategic tool that increases raid efficiency,
boosts candy gains, and strengthens group coordination.
</p>

<p>
To maximize its benefits, always match your Mega type to the raid boss,
coordinate with teammates, and invest in raising Mega Levels over time.
Used correctly, Mega Evolution can transform you into a top-tier raid trainer.
