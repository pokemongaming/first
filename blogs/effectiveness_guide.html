<h1>The Complete Pokémon GO Type Effectiveness Guide (2026 Edition)</h1>

<p>
Understanding type effectiveness is one of the most important skills in Pokémon GO. 
Whether you're battling in raids, gyms, Team GO Rocket fights, or PvP leagues, 
knowing which types deal super-effective damage can dramatically increase your success rate.
This complete 2026 guide explains how type matchups work, how to calculate damage multipliers, 
how double weaknesses function, and how to use this knowledge to build stronger raid teams.
</p>

<h2>What Is Type Effectiveness?</h2>

<p>
Every Pokémon and every move in Pokémon GO has a type. 
When a move hits a Pokémon, the damage depends on how those types interact.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Super Effective:</strong> Deals 1.6× damage</li>
<li><strong>Not Very Effective:</strong> Deals 0.625× damage</li>
<li><strong>Double Weakness:</strong> Deals 2.56× damage</li>
<li><strong>Double Resistance:</strong> Deals 0.39× damage</li>
</ul>

<p>
This multiplier system is why using the correct counter in raids makes such a huge difference. 
A properly matched team can defeat a boss nearly twice as fast as a team using neutral damage.
</p>

<h2>All 18 Pokémon Types Explained</h2>

<p>
There are 18 different Pokémon types in Pokémon GO:
</p>

<p>
Normal, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying,
Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Dragon, Dark, Steel, and Fairy.
</p>

<p>
Each type has strengths and weaknesses. Learning these interactions is essential for building strong teams.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Raid Weakness Examples</h2>

<h3>🔥 Fire-Type Weaknesses</h3>
<p>
Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water, Rock, and Ground moves.
Using strong Water attackers in rainy weather can quickly defeat Fire-type raid bosses.
</p>

<h3>⚡ Electric-Type Weaknesses</h3>
<p>
Electric-type Pokémon are weak only to Ground moves.
This makes Ground-type Pokémon extremely valuable in Electric raids.
</p>

<h3>🐉 Dragon-Type Weaknesses</h3>
<p>
Dragon-types are weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy moves.
Ice-types are particularly effective because many Dragon Pokémon have secondary Flying typing,
creating a double weakness.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Is a Double Weakness?</h2>

<p>
Some Pokémon have two types. If both types are weak to the same attacking type,
the damage multiplier stacks.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A Dragon/Flying Pokémon hit by an Ice move takes 2.56× damage.</li>
<li>A Rock/Ground Pokémon hit by a Water move takes massive damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why identifying dual typings is crucial before entering a raid.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB)</h2>

<p>
When a Pokémon uses a move that matches its own type, it receives a Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB).
In Pokémon GO, STAB increases damage by 1.2×.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A Water-type Pokémon using a Water move deals extra damage.</li>
<li>A Fighting-type Pokémon using Counter benefits from STAB.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Combining STAB with super-effective damage results in maximum DPS.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Weather Boost and Type Effectiveness</h2>

<p>
Weather affects battle performance in Pokémon GO.
Each weather type boosts specific move types by 20%.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunny boosts Fire, Grass, Ground</li>
<li>Rainy boosts Water, Electric, Bug</li>
<li>Cloudy boosts Fighting, Fairy, Poison</li>
<li>Windy boosts Dragon, Flying, Psychic</li>
<li>Snow boosts Ice, Steel</li>
<li>Partly Cloudy boosts Rock, Normal</li>
<li>Fog boosts Dark, Ghost</li>
</ul>

<p>
Weather boosts stack with type effectiveness, making proper team selection even more important.
</p>

<h2>How to Build a Strong Raid Team Using Type Advantage</h2>

<h3>1. Identify the Boss Typing</h3>
<p>
Always check whether the boss has one or two types.
</p>

<h3>2. Look for Double Weakness Opportunities</h3>
<p>
If the boss has a double weakness, prioritize Pokémon of that type.
</p>

<h3>3. Use High DPS Counters</h3>
<p>
Choose Pokémon with strong fast and charged moves that benefit from STAB.
</p>

<h3>4. Consider Weather</h3>
<p>
If the weather boosts your counters, your raid becomes easier.
If it boosts the boss, prepare stronger attackers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Type Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using resisted moves against raid bosses</li>
<li>Ignoring dual typing</li>
<li>Not checking weather boost</li>
<li>Using low-DPS defensive Pokémon in raids</li>
</ul>

<p>
Avoiding these mistakes can significantly improve your raid efficiency.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Type Knowledge Matters in PvP</h2>

<p>
In PvP battles, energy management and type coverage are crucial.
Knowing which types resist your opponent’s moves allows you to switch safely
and preserve shields effectively.
</p>

<p>
Strong PvP teams typically include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A safe switch with neutral coverage</li>
<li>A hard counter to common meta threats</li>
<li>A closer with strong charged moves</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
Mastering type effectiveness in Pokémon GO is the foundation of becoming a stronger trainer.
Whether you focus on raids, PvP, or gym battles, understanding strengths, weaknesses,
STAB bonuses, and weather interactions gives you a competitive advantage.
</p>

<p>
Before every raid or battle, take a moment to analyze the opponent’s typing.
Choosing the right counters can cut your battle time dramatically and improve your success rate.
