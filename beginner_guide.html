<p>
Legendary Raids are among the most exciting and challenging features in Pokémon GO.
They give trainers the opportunity to catch powerful Legendary Pokémon,
earn rare rewards, and test their battle strategies against high-CP bosses.
</p>

<p>
If you're new to raids or unsure how Legendary Raids work,

</p>

<h2>What Are Legendary Raids?</h2>

<p>
Legendary Raids are Tier 5 raid battles that feature Legendary Pokémon.
These bosses have extremely high Combat Power (CP)
and require multiple trainers to defeat.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Appear in Tier 5 Raid Eggs</li>
<li>Limited-time rotation schedule</li>
<li>Require Raid Pass to enter</li>
<li>Usually need 3–6 trainers to win</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because of their strength, preparation is essential before entering.
</p>

<h2>How to Join a Legendary Raid</h2>

<h3>1️⃣ Find an Active Raid</h3>
<p>
Check nearby gyms for a Tier 5 egg or active Legendary boss.
</p>

<h3>2️⃣ Use a Raid Pass</h3>
<p>
You can use:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Daily Free Raid Pass</li>
<li>Premium Raid Pass</li>
<li>Remote Raid Pass</li>
</ul>

<h3>3️⃣ Join with Other Trainers</h3>
<p>
Legendary Raids are rarely soloable.
Join a local group or invite friends remotely.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Recommended Trainer Level</h2>

<p>
While you can technically join raids at lower levels,
Level 30+ trainers are generally more prepared
with stronger Pokémon and better counters.
</p>

<p>
However, even lower-level trainers can contribute
if they use correct type advantages.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How to Choose the Right Counters</h2>

<p>
The most important factor in winning a Legendary Raid
is type effectiveness.
</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Counter Selection</h3>

<ul>
<li>Identify the boss typing</li>
<li>Check its weaknesses</li>
<li>Choose Pokémon with super-effective moves</li>
<li>Avoid resisted move types</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using proper counters can reduce battle time significantly.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding Raid Rewards</h2>

<p>
After defeating a Legendary Raid boss, you receive:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rare Candy</li>
<li>Golden Razz Berries</li>
<li>Technical Machines (TMs)</li>
<li>XP rewards</li>
<li>Chance to catch the Legendary Pokémon</li>
</ul>

<p>
The faster you defeat the boss,
the more Premier Balls you receive for catching.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How to Catch Legendary Pokémon More Easily</h2>

<h3>1️⃣ Use Golden Razz Berries</h3>
<p>
Always use Golden Razz Berries for maximum catch chance.
</p>

<h3>2️⃣ Throw Curveballs</h3>
<p>
Curveball throws increase catch probability.
</p>

<h3>3️⃣ Aim for Excellent Throws</h3>
<p>
Excellent throws provide the highest catch bonus.
Practice consistent timing.
</p>

<h3>4️⃣ Be Patient</h3>
<p>
Wait for the attack animation to finish before throwing.
This reduces wasted balls.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Weather Boost in Legendary Raids</h2>

<p>
If the raid boss is weather-boosted:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It appears at a higher level</li>
<li>It has increased CP</li>
<li>It is harder to defeat</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, weather boost also increases IV floor,
which may result in stronger catches.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using recommended party without checking type</li>
<li>Joining raids without enough trainers</li>
<li>Not reviving fainted Pokémon between attempts</li>
<li>Ignoring Mega Evolution boosts</li>
</ul>

<p>
Avoiding these mistakes improves your win rate significantly.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Remote Raiding Tips</h2>

<p>
Remote Raid Passes allow you to join raids worldwide.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Coordinate via friend invites</li>
<li>Join raid communities</li>
<li>Check global raid rotations</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remote raids are excellent for region-exclusive Legendary Pokémon.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Is Legendary Raiding Worth It?</h2>

<p>
Yes. Legendary Pokémon are among the strongest attackers in the game.
They are essential for advanced raids, PvP battles,
and competitive team building.
</p>

<p>
Regular participation helps you build a powerful roster over time.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
Legendary Raids may seem intimidating at first,
but with proper preparation and correct counters,
they become manageable and rewarding.
</p>

<p>
Focus on type advantage, coordinate with other trainers,
use Golden Razz Berries wisely,
and practice Excellent throws.
With time and experience,
you will become a confident Legendary raider.
